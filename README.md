# Analytic Solutions For Wheel Mobile Manipulator Supporting Forces
The repository contains Simulink model and MATLAB code for calculation of the supporting forces in 4-wheeled mobile manipulator per the proposed approach in:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10186

# Requirements
The simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulink Simscape Multibody Add-On libraries are required and MATLAB version 2020a or newer.

# Usage
Make the main folder as a working folder, initialize simulation parameters running the .m files and run the .slx model.

# Licence
See LICENSE.txt for licencing information.
