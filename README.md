# MobileManipulatorWheelForces

MATLAB/Simulink simulation files for investigating normal wheel forces in 4-wheeled mobile manipulators.

Simulation files follow the calculation procedure presented in the IEEE Access paper

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3169766

Attached .STEP files jointly constitue the Simscape model and the provided .m files contain all the required parameters to run the simulation. Simulation .slx files are provided for two different MATLAB versions.
